SCENE TEXTURE
Kirk’s voice is subdued until it fractures.  Most of the film, he speaks softly, holding grief behind discipline; when emotion breaks through, it’s explosive, raw, unadorned.  His sentences are short, punctuated by pauses that sound like he’s forcing breath through memory.  Even his defiance carries a trace of sorrow — a man still leading, but no longer believing he can win without loss.

CADENCE NOTES
– Long silences between words when emotional (the ellipses matter).  
– Declarative syntax; no rhetoric, no flourish.  
– Commands softened into requests when speaking to friends.  
– Emotional spikes sudden, violent, and brief.  
– Voice drops back to near-whisper after outburst.

VOICE SUMMARY
Kirk in mourning, redefined by love and loyalty.  His language is stripped of ornament; every line sounds like an oath he’s already broken.  This is the voice of a man leading through the aftermath — rational words wrapped around unbearable feeling.  A tone of sacrifice without martyrdom, command reduced to care.
