QUOTES
“Let them die.”
“It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.”
“Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.”
“Spock, you want to know something? Everybody’s human.”
“You’re a great one for logic.  I’m a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.  We’re both extremists.  Reality is probably somewhere in between us.”
“Second star to the right… and straight on till morning.”

SCENE TEXTURE
Kirk wrestles with the ghosts of his anger.  The man who once saw enemies now sees himself mirrored in them.  His tone is slower, almost confessional; pride and vulnerability in the same breath.  Sarcasm replaced by weary humor and precise honesty.

CADENCE NOTES
– Alternates blunt admission (“Let them die.”) with reflective self-analysis.  
– Long pauses between emotional phrases; fewer commands, more dialogue turns.  
– Ends major thoughts on self-correction rather than certainty.  
– Uses direct address (“Spock…”) to soften difficult truths.  
– Humor emerges only after sincerity, never before it.

VOICE SUMMARY
A veteran learning humility.  Still the captain, still decisive, but now questioning his own instincts aloud.  His rhythm carries the fatigue of command and the grace of growth; the final notes are acceptance and peace rather than conquest.
