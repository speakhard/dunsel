QUOTES
“Genius doesn’t come in bottles, Bones.”
“Commodore, this machine is murdering my crew!”
“We’re human beings, Doctor.  The right to make mistakes — that’s what makes command different.”
“Captain to Daystrom: we can stop the M-5 together.  You created it; you can help me shut it down!”
“Computer, cease fire!  You’ve killed four hundred and thirty men!”
“Will we ever learn?  The purpose is to find a reason to live.”

SCENE TEXTURE
Kirk starts formal, constrained by hierarchy, then flares into moral outrage as the M-5 system kills without empathy.  His speech is direct, uncluttered; each word lands like a gavel strike.  He argues ethics through procedure, turning technical dialogue into moral indictment.

CADENCE NOTES
– Alternates cool command tone with sudden bursts of anger.  
– Uses declaratives and imperatives in quick succession (“Computer, cease fire!”).  
– Shifts to quiet reflection after crisis; final lines almost elegiac.  
– Repeats key nouns (“machine,” “man”) for emphasis.  
– Humor absent; replaced by sharp irony.

VOICE SUMMARY
Kirk as moral advocate: the human element defending judgment against automation.  His language is crisp, logical, but undercut with visible emotion.  Each order doubles as philosophy — efficiency versus conscience, calculation versus compassion.  The cadence is courtroom-tight, the delivery personal.  A command voice arguing for the soul of command itself.
